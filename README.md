# NoodleType Project

NoodleType - A cross-platform application for training the speed of typing from the keyboard, useful both for ordinary users and for programmers who want to speed up typing. 

## Installation Guide üöÄ

This project requires several external libraries and uses **Git submodules**. Follow the instructions below to set up the project on different platforms.

## Cloning the Repository with Submodules üì•

Since this project includes submodules, you need to clone it with the `--recurse-submodules` flag:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LoFiwi/NoodleType
```

If you have already cloned the repository without submodules, initialize them manually:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Notes üìù

- Ensure that **vcpkg** is installed and correctly set up for each platform to manage dependencies easily.
- If using **vcpkg**, make sure the toolchain file is specified during the CMake configuration step.
- **GLFW**, **GLEW**, and **curlpp** are essential for this project. If they are not installed globally, install them via vcpkg or package managers (Linux/Mac).
